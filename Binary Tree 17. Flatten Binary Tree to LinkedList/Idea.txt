Approach: Recurse the binary tree in Inorder Format, at every stage of function call pass on the address of last node 
in the flattened linked list so that current node can make itself a right node of the last node.


1.For left child, it’s parent node is the last node in the flattened list
2.For the right child there are two conditions:

1.If there is no left child to the parent, parent node is the last node in the flattened list.
2.If left child is not null then leaf node from left sub-tree is the last node in the flattened list.
